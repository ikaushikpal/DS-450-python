# Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

# The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

# It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.



# Example 1:
# Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
# Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
# Explanation:
# 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
# 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
# These are the only two combinations.


# Example 2:
# Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
# Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]


# Example 3:
# Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
# Output: []

# Time Complexity: O(2^target * k)
# where k is the average number of len(candidates)
# why 2^target. lets say arr = [1, 1, 1] and target = 4
# then for each 1 there is lot of ways to make 4.
# first 1 can occur as 1, 1, 1, 1 and 1, 1, 1, 1 and 1, 1, 1, 1
