# Given an integer N denoting the Length of a line segment. You need to cut the line segment in such a way that the cut length of a line segment each time is either x , y or z. Here x, y, and z are integers.
# After performing all the cut operations, your total number of cut segments must be maximum.


# Example 1:
# Input:
# N = 4
# x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
# Output: 4
# Explanation:Total length is 4, and the cut
# lengths are 2, 1 and 1.  We can make
# maximum 4 segments each of length 1.


# Example 2:
# Input:
# N = 5
# x = 5, y = 3, z = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Here total length is 5, and
# the cut lengths are 5, 3 and 2. We can
# make two segments of lengths 3 and 2.
