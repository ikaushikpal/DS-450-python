# You are given an integer array arr of length n that represents a permutation of the integers in the range [0, n - 1].
# We split arr into some number of chunks (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.
# Return the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.

 
# Example 1:

# Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
# For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.

# Example 2:

# Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
# However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
